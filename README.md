# Bamazon

The goal of this activity was to create a storefront app, similar to Amazon, that uses MySQL and runs in the terminal using node.js. Itâ€™s most basic function is to take an order from a customer and then present a bill for items ordered, while removing products from the inventory as the ordered goes through. 

The customer is first presented with a table showing items for sale, along with the product ids and prices per unit. The customer is then asked to enter the id of the product they wish to buy. An error message will indicate if the product does not exist or the id number is entered incorrectly. When a correct id is entered, the customer is asked to enter how many they wish to buy.

The final step is to present a bill to the customer for the items ordered and to remove the purchased units from the inventory count.  

Here is a link to a video showing how the app works:
